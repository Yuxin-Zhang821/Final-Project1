# Final-Project1
Final project of MY472 Data for Data Scientist
### _Data science is about bringing clarity to ambiguous situations_

Inside and outside academia, one of the most important skills of a data scientist is to be able to take an ambiguous set of instructions and generate a work product that brings structure and clarity to other people, such as your manager or other academics reviewing your work. This is one of the major themes of this course. We have purposefully pushed you to think creatively, troubleshoot problems on your own, and complete assessments with less guidance than you were probably used to as an undergraduate student. In our view, success in this course is _not_ about how well you can regurgitate lines of code; it is about well you can manage an ambiguous situation and generate useful, impactful and reproducible work.

For this final assessment, you will complete an **_independent data science report_**. The report should accompany new real-world data, which you will compile, clean and organise on your own using the skills you have learned in this course. As you will see below, this assessment is more open-ended than the previous assessments; this is on purpose. It is now your turn to demonstrate you have learned how to bring clarity to ambiguous situations, and that you are ready to take on the work of a data scientist.

### Overview

You should select **one** of the **3 options** given below to be the "prompt" for your project. These prompts are purposefully broad and you will have to decide how best to narrow the scope to meet the requirements of the assessment. You will then compile and use data relating to your prompt, summarising it in a report. A future person should be able to read your report, fully understand your process, fully reproduce your work, and use your dataset for their own research project. You must produce new _real-world_ data.

**Prompt 1:** Pretend that you have just started a new job as a junior data scientist at a public policy think tank. The think tank is growing and becoming more influential, so your manager has asked you to compile new data relating to an important public policy problem, which could be used by the think tank to prepare future analyses. You have _not_ been asked to complete these analyses; your primary task is to produce the new data and prepare a report that introduces it and justifies why the data is important and promising.
 
**Prompt 2:** Pretend that you are a PhD student in social science discipline. You are working with your supervisor to put together a grant to fund a new social science research project. Your supervisor has asked you to compile new data relating to your primary research interest, which could be used to write a future article analysing the data. You have _not_ been asked to write an article analysing the data; your primary task is to produce the new data and prepare a report that introduces it and justifies why the data is important and promising.

**Prompt 3:** Pretend that you are a junior data scientist that has just been hired to a professional job by a large organisation (e.g., a company, a foundation, a government, a university, etc.). You were hired because the organisation is struggling to meet it core objective (e.g., hitting a revenue target, increasing enrolment, etc.). Your boss has asked you to compile new data that the organisation could analyse in order to better understand why its objectives aren't being met. You have _not_ been asked to complete these analyses; your primary task is to produce the new data and prepare a report that introduces it and justifies why the data is important and promising.
